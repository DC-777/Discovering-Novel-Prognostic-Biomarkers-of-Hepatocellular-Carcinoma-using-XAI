# Discovering-Novel-Prognostic-Biomarkers-of-Hepatocellular-Carcinoma-using-XAI
A multi-model XAI and a probabilistic causal inference framework to identify and validate key genetic biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis.
Our methodology involved analyzing clinical and gene expression data to identify potential biomarkers with prognostic significance. The study utilized AI models validated against gene expression datasets, demonstrating not only the predictive accuracy but also the clinical relevance of the identified biomarkers through explainable metrics. The findings highlight the importance of biomarkers such as TOP3B, SSBP3, and COX7A2L, which were consistently influential across multiple models, suggesting their role in improving the predictive accuracy for HCC prognosis beyond AFP. The application of XAI in biomarker discovery represents a significant advancement in HCC research, offering a more nuanced understanding of the disease and laying the groundwork for improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
